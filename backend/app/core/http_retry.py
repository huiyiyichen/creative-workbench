"""HTTP retry helper for scraper-style GET requests.

Scraper modules (qimao, zhihu, heiyan, …) each had their own retry loop
with linear backoff.  This module provides a single ``retry_http_get``
that handles the loop, logging, and backoff, returning the ``httpx.Response``
on success or ``None`` on exhaustion.

Callers that need custom success validation (e.g. payload["code"] == 1)
can inspect the response and re-raise to trigger a retry.
